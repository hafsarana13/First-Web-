    <h1>Pak Army Foje </h1>
    The primary objective and constitutional mission of the Pakistan Army is to ensure the national security and
    national unity of Pakistan by defending it against any form of external aggression or the threat of war. It can also
    be requisitioned by the Pakistani federal government to respond to internal threats within its borders.[7] During
    events of national and international calamities and emergencies, it conducts humanitarian rescue operations at home
    and is an active participant in peacekeeping missions mandated by the United Nations (UN)â€”most notably playing a
    major role in rescuing trapped American soldiers who had requested for a quick reaction force during Operation
    Gothic Serpent in Somalia. Troops from the Pakistan Army also had a relatively strong presence as part of a larger
    UN and NATO coalition during the Bosnian War and larger Yugoslav Wars.:
