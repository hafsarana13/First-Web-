    <h1>Pak Army Foje </h1>

    <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu: محمد علی جناح; [mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli d͡ʒɪnɑː(ɦ)]; born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December
        1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader
        of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the
        Dominion of Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon
        his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
        eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first
        two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim
        unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
        Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
        fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
        subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
        satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.</P>
