    <h1>Flag o<i>f</i> Pakistan </h1>

    <P> The national flag of Pakistan, also known as the Flag of the Star and Crescent (Urdu: پرچمِ ستارہ و ہلال), is
        made up of a green field with a stylized tilted white crescent moon and five-pointed star at its centre, and a
        vertical white stripe at its hoist-end. Though the specific shade of green on the flag is mandated only as 'dark
        green',[1] its official and most consistent representation is in Pakistan green, which is shaded distinctively
        darker. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 11 August 1947, and it became the official
        flag of the Dominion of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, following independence from the British Empire.[2][3][4] The
        flag was subsequently retained as that of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956, and remains in use as the
        national flag to this day.</P>
